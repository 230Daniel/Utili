    <h2 id="overview">OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from <a class="a-blue" href="https://utili.xyz">https://utili.xyz</a> (the “Site”).</p>
    <h2 id="personal-information-we-collect">PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
    <p>As you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>
    <p>Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, email address, and phone number.  We refer to this information as “Order Information.”</p>
    <p>Information about your Discord account may also be recorded. This includes your Discord User ID, the email address on your Discord account, and the Discord servers (guilds) which you are a member of.</p>
    <p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.</p>
    <h2 id="how-do-we-use-your-personal-information?">HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p>
        We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfil any orders placed through the Site (such as providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations and granting you access to the products you have purchased).  Additionally, we may use this Order Information to:
        Communicate with you;
        Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
        When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.
    </p>
    <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>
    <h2 id="sharing-your-personal-information">SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above.  For example, we use Stripe to power our payments and subscriptions. You can read more about how Stripe uses your Personal Information here:  <a class="a-blue" href="https://stripe.com/privacy">https://stripe.com/privacy</a>.</p>
    <p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>
    <h2 id="do-not-track">DO NOT TRACK</h2>
    <p>Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.</p>
    <h2 id="your-rights">YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>
    <p>Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you (for example if you make an order through the Site), or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.  Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside of Europe, including to the United States.</p>
    <h2 id="data-retention">DATA RETENTION</h2>
    <p>When you place an order through the Site, we will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.</p>

    <h2 id="changes">CHANGES</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy at any time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
