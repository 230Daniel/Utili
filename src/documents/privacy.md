# Privacy Policy

## Overview

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from https://utili.xyz (the "Site"), and how any sensitive information is processed and stored by the associated Discord bot Utili#5921 (the "Bot").

## Sensitive Information we collect

When you log in to the Site via Discord, we store your unique Discord account ID and its associated email address. We refer to this information as "Account Information".

The Site will also retrieve information about the Discord guilds which you are a member of, however this data will not be stored permanently.

When you add the Bot to a Discord guild it will begin retrieving information about that guild and its members in order to function properly. By default, no data is stored for a guild which the Bot is added to.

Some features of the Bot require the storage of sensitive information to function. When these features are enabled via the Site, the Bot will begin collecting and storing the information described in the table below. If the feature can be enabled within a smaller scope than the entire guild, only the information within the smaller scope will be stored. If the feature is disabled again via the Site, no more data will be collected and stored. We refer to this infromation as "Sensitive Discord Information".

| Feature       | Scope                               | Sensitive information stored if this feature is enabled within the scope                                         | Why this information is required for the feature to function                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Autopurge     | Per-Channel                         | The metadata of messages sent within the last 14 days (timestamp, is message pinned, is sender a bot)            | To avoid requesting information on a channel's messages from Discord every time the Bot checks for messages which are due for deletion, metadata about messages is fetched once and then updated whenever necessary                       |
| Inactive Role | Per-Guild                           | A timestamp for each member in the guild which describes when they last sent a message or joined a voice channel | To determine which users haven't been active for long enough to be marked as inactive                                                                                                                                                     |
| Message Logs  | Per-Guild with Per-Channel override | The content and metadata of messages sent within the last 30 days (author id, timestamp, content)                | Once a message has been edited or deleted its previous state is not accessible, so information must be stored about messages before they are edited or deleted in order for it to be possible to retrieve the previous state of a message |
| Role Persist  | Per-Guild with Per-Role override    | The IDs of the roles that a member had when they left the guild                                                  | To add the roles back once the member rejoins                                                                                                                                                                                             |
